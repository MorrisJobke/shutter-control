# ── Physical wall buttons ──────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Wall buttons (e.g. Eltako FT55) that directly control shutters via
# EnOcean radio. When a button press is detected, the bridge updates
# the position tracking for all associated shutters so that Home
# Assistant stays in sync.
#
# Each button has an EnOcean ID and a list of shutter IDs it controls.
# A single button can control multiple shutters (e.g. all shutters in
# a room).
buttons:
  - id: "FE:12:34:56"            # EnOcean ID of the wall button
    shutters:                     # shutters this button controls

# ── Teach-in (pairing) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Each FSB61NP-230V must be paired with the USB 300 gateway before it
# will respond to commands. Do this once per actuator:
#
#   1. On the FSB61NP, turn the upper rotary switch to "LRN".
#      The LED starts blinking (you have about 1 minute).
#   2. Send a teach-in telegram via MQTT:
#        Topic:   enocean/cover/<safe_id>/teach_in
#        Payload: 1
#      (safe_id = the device ID without colons, e.g. "05123456")
#      You can use HA Developer Tools > Services > MQTT: Publish.
#   3. The actuator confirms by turning the LED off.
#   4. Turn the upper rotary switch back to the desired mode (e.g. "GS1").
#
# Repeat for each shutter you want to control.
